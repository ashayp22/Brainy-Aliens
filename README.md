[Brainy Aliens](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/brainy-aliens/id1441222991?l=en) is a basketball shooting game where you compete against the AI to see who can make the most shots. The game provides an enjoyable and competitive experience due to its many features and options.

I made this during the summer in between my Freshman and Sophomore year of high school (Summer 2018). 

## CONTROLS

Dragging and releasing the ball is how you shoot the ball, making gameplay very basic.


## SPECIAL OPTIONS

Power-ups can be used when playing against the AI, thus making it easier to win.


## ADVANCED AI

The computer's shot is controlled by a sophisticated AI that can match your skills.


## SIMPLE UI

It's very easy to maneuver between gameplay and the settings.


## COMPETITON

See how many times you can beat the AI and view your statistics. Also, compare your win to loss ratio among your friends to see who is the best.
